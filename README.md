# Micro service work - FIAP

Communicate different microservices using different protocols with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Description

Demonstrate the use of microservices using different communication protocols, for this study we will use [HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP) and [gRPC](https://grpc.io/).

the application will be built with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and the database used will be [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)

## Getting Started
install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)

### Dependencies

* Node.js
* MongoDB

### Installing

* clone this repository
```
git clone git@github.com:DaniloP85/mob-25-info-financeiras.git
```
* Install all dependencies
```
npm install --verbose
```

### Executing program

* To execute the project
```
npm start
```

after that, it will be necessary to have some tool that makes requests gRPC.

For testing purposes I used [Insonmia](https://github.com/DaniloP85/mob-25-fiap), but you can use whatever you think is best.
